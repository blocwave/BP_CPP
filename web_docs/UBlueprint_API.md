# UBlueprint API Documentation

Source: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UBlueprint?application_version=5.2

## Class Definition

```cpp
class UBlueprint : public UBlueprintCore, public IBlueprintPropertyGuidProvider
```

## Purpose

Blueprints are special assets that provide an intuitive, node-based interface that can be used to create new types of Actors and script level events; giving designers and gameplay programmers the tools to quickly create and iterate gameplay from within Unreal Editor without ever needing to write a line of code.

## Key Properties

### Compilation State
- `bBeingCompiled` (uint8: 1) - The blueprint is currently compiled
- `bQueuedForCompilation` (uint8: 1) - Blueprint is queued for compilation
- `bRecompileOnLoad` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not this blueprint should recompile itself on load
- `bHasBeenRegenerated` (uint8: 1) - When the class generated by this blueprint is loaded, it will be recompiled the first time
- `bIsRegeneratingOnLoad` (uint8: 1) - State flag to indicate whether or not the Blueprint is currently being regenerated on load

### Blueprint Configuration
- `BlueprintType` (TEnumAsByte<EBlueprintType>) - The type of this blueprint
- `BlueprintCategory` (FString) - The category of the Blueprint, used to organize this Blueprint class when displayed in palette windows
- `BlueprintDescription` (FString) - Shows up in the content browser tooltip when the blueprint is hovered
- `BlueprintDisplayName` (FString) - Overrides the BP's display name in the editor UI
- `BlueprintNamespace` (FString) - The namespace of this blueprint (if set, the Blueprint will be treated differently for the context menu)
- `BlueprintSystemVersion` (int32) - The version of the blueprint system that was used to create this blueprint

### Class Generation
- `bGenerateAbstractClass` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not this blueprint's class is a abstract class or not
- `bGenerateConstClass` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not this blueprint's class is a const class or not
- `bDeprecate` (uint8: 1) - Deprecates the Blueprint, marking the generated class with the CLASS_Deprecated flag

### Editor Behavior
- `bAllowDeletion` (uint8: 1) - If true, graph can be deleted from the whatever container it is in
- `bForceFullEditor` (uint8: 1) - Whether to force opening the full (non data-only) editor for this blueprint
- `bIsNewlyCreated` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not this blueprint is newly created, and hasn't been opened in an editor yet
- `bDisplayCompilePIEWarning` (uint8: 1) - TRUE to show a warning when attempting to start in PIE and there is a compiler error on this Blueprint

### Construction Script
- `bRunConstructionScriptInSequencer` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not you want to continuously rerun the construction script for an actor in sequencer
- `bRunConstructionScriptOnDrag` (uint8: 1) - Whether or not you want to continuously rerun the construction script for an actor as you drag it in the editor

### Internal State
- `bCachedDependenciesUpToDate` (bool) - Transient flag that indicates whether or not the internal dependency cache needs to be updated
- `bDuplicatingReadOnly` (uint8: 1) - Flag indicating that a read only duplicate of this blueprint is being created

## Key Methods

### Class Management
- `GetBlueprintClass()` - Gets the class generated when this blueprint is compiled
- `RegenerateClass(UClass* ClassToRegenerate, UObject* PreviousCDO)` - Called on the target when a class is loaded with ClassGeneratedBy is loaded
- `AlwaysCompileOnLoad()` - Allows derived blueprints to require compilation on load
- `CanAlwaysRecompileWhilePlayingInEditor()` - Some Blueprints (and classes) can recompile while we are debugging a live session

### Graph and Node Management
- `NotifyGraphRenamed(UEdGraph* Graph, FName OldName, FName NewName)` - Notify the blueprint when a graph is renamed to allow for additional fixups
- `GetAllGraphs(TArray<UEdGraph*>& Graphs)` - Gets all graphs in the blueprint

### Extension Management
- `AddExtension(const TObjectPtr<UBlueprintExtension>& InExtension)` - Adds given extension, broadcasting on add

### Event Broadcasting
- `BroadcastChanged()` - Broadcast that the blueprint has changed
- `BroadcastCompiled()` - Broadcast that compilation has completed

### Editor Integration
- `ClearEditorReferences()` - Clears out any editor data regarding a blueprint class
- `ConformNativeComponents()` - Updates the blueprint's OwnedComponents to reflect changes made natively

### Debugging
- `SetObjectBeingDebugged(UObject* NewObject)` - Sets the current object being debugged
- `UnregisterObjectBeingDebugged()` - Clears the current object being debugged

### Messaging
- `Message_Error(const FString& MessageToLog, ArgTypes... Args)` - Log an error message
- `Message_Warn(const FString& MessageToLog, ArgTypes... Args)` - Log a warning message
- `Message_Note(const FString& MessageToLog, ArgTypes... Args)` - Send a message to the CurrentMessageLog

### Validation
- `IsBlueprintHierarchyErrorFree(const UClass* InClass)` - Returns true if the class hierarchy is error free
- `AllowFunctionOverride(const UFunction* const InFunction)` - Returns true if this blueprints allows the given function to be overridden

### Module Management
- `LoadModulesRequiredForCompilation()` - Blueprint can choose to load specific modules for compilation

### Template Management
- `ChangeOwnerOfTemplates()` - Change ownership of component templates

### Lifecycle
- `PostLoad()` - Do any object-specific cleanup required immediately after loading an object

## Notes

- The full UBlueprint API documentation is extremely large (>46,000 tokens) and requires manual copying from the Epic documentation site
- This class is central to the Blueprint compilation system and manages the entire Blueprint asset
- It works closely with UBlueprintGeneratedClass to create the runtime representation of Blueprint classes
